# QBO parity progress

## 01 Review rules from the Q4 pack (2026-10-16)

Plan: `2026-10-16-qbo-01-review-rules.md` (Decisions section there).

Shipped:
- Extraction reads `cash_tendered`, `change`, `payment_terms`, `marked_paid` (optional; old replies still parse).
- New review reasons: `tendered_less_than_total`, `ewt_expected` (suggested ATC + amount in `review_notes`),
  `payment_source_unknown`, `payment_unverified` (soft: never queues or blocks close), `duplicate_invoice_number`
  (per-supplier number reuse on another date; shows in the duplicate compare view), `personal_purchase`.
- `vat_math_mismatch` alone no longer loses input VAT: books and 2550-Q claim min(printed, 12%), excess to new chart
  account `1310 VAT difference - for review` (seeded into existing charts by `ensure_chart`).
- Purchases in an owner's/officer's name (new company field "Owner / officer names", plus the books signatory) are
  excluded by default.
- Payment flags cleared by evidence via `review_rules.sync_payment_flags` (paid_on, linked receipt; bank lines next).
- New columns: `aa_documents.review_notes`, `aa_companies.owner_names`.
- UI: labels + details in the document panel, soft reasons as a neutral note, badges, guide line.
- Q4 fixtures: Luzon Paint SI 5838 duplicate, Golden ₱2,600 vs ₱2,400, Reyes Santos RS-1048, Tindahan 0048029,
  13th month ₱120,000, Pacific Steel credit terms, p38 owner's name.

Tests: 569 → 592 passing. Gates: pytest, ruff, lint, tsc, build all green.

Not done: existing documents are not re-classified (old `vat_math_mismatch` docs keep input VAT disallowed);
`payment_source_unknown` for BOC freight/brokerage waits on the landed-cost CPA question; A/P aging display of
`payment_unverified` belongs to workstream 04.
